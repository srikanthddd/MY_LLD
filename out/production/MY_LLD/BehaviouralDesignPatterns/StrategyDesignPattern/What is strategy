Simple :

- If you see there is any change in the implementation (behaviour) during the run-time, then we go with this Pattern.


PlayerBehaviour -->
    - Defense Behaviour
    - Attack Behaviour

-> You pass the constructor, what behaviour you want and it creates that object and implement during the run time.
