* Flyweight design pattern says, "Remove you weight and then fly.
* Separate the Intrinsic and Extrinsic properties & add them in the Bullet and FlyingBullet classes respectively.
Then add "Bullet" attribute in FlyingBullet class.

Intrinsic ==> Not going to change.
Extrinsic ==> Depends on environment, will change.

* If the repetition of the Intrinsic properties is leading to a lot of memory usage, consider removing Intrinsic properties from the Object.
